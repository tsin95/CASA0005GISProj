# Intelligent policing: a GIS approach to spatialising crime

Hello and welcome! I am a student at University College London's The Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analytics (CASA). 

This is the publication of my code and output (in the "My Code and Outputs" tab above), as well as data (files referred to in the code are stored in my repository at https://github.com/tsin95/CASA0005GISProj) for the final GIS project (CASA0005). 

Have fun looking through, and please find my thanks given to those who have helped me on the "Acknowledgements and Links" tab above!
